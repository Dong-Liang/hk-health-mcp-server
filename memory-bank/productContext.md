# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The HK Health MCP Server project exists to address the need for accessible, real-time information on health services in Hong Kong. Many residents and healthcare providers lack immediate access to data regarding waiting times at Accident and Emergency Departments, specialist outpatient services, and general outpatient clinic quotas, which can impact decision-making and planning.

## Problems It Solves
- **Information Gap**: Bridges the gap between official health service data and end-users by providing a programmatic way to access waiting times and quotas.
- **Decision Support**: Helps patients and providers make informed decisions about where and when to seek medical care based on current service loads.
- **Integration**: Offers developers a way to integrate health service data into applications, enhancing user experiences with relevant, timely information.

## How It Should Work
- **Data Retrieval**: The system fetches data from official Hong Kong health service sources at regular intervals or on-demand.
- **API Access**: Exposes this data through MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, allowing seamless integration into third-party applications.
- **Accuracy and Timeliness**: Ensures that the data provided is accurate and reflects the most current information available.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing data requests and potential expansion to include additional health service metrics.

## User Experience Goals
- **For Developers**: Provide clear documentation, reliable API endpoints, and easy integration with minimal setup.
- **For End-Users**: Ensure that applications using this data present it in an intuitive, actionable way, reducing the complexity of navigating health service options.
- **For Administrators**: Offer insights into service loads that can inform resource allocation and operational planning.
