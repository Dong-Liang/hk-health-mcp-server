# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on establishing the foundational structure for the HK Health MCP Server project. This includes setting up the Memory Bank for documentation and ensuring all core files are in place to maintain project context across sessions.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's core requirements and goals.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the purpose, problems solved, operational model, and user experience goals of the project.
- Initiated the setup of the Memory Bank directory to store all documentation files.

## Next Steps
1. Complete the creation of remaining core Memory Bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
2. Review and refine the content of all Memory Bank files to ensure accuracy and relevance.
3. Begin development of the MCP server tools for fetching and presenting health service data, starting with Accident and Emergency Department waiting times.
4. Document any new patterns or insights discovered during the development process in the appropriate Memory Bank files.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Determining the frequency of data updates from official sources to balance timeliness with server load.
- Considering the potential need for caching mechanisms to improve response times for frequent queries.
- Evaluating the structure for future expansion to include additional health service data beyond waiting times and quotas.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Maintain a clear hierarchy in documentation as outlined in the Memory Bank structure to ensure easy navigation and understanding.
- Use Markdown for all documentation to facilitate readability and version control.
- Prioritize modularity in code design to allow for easy addition of new data tools or services.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The importance of comprehensive documentation from the project's outset to mitigate issues arising from memory resets.
- Initial setup of documentation can serve as a blueprint for other MCP server projects, potentially streamlining future development efforts.
