# Project Brief

## Overview
This document serves as the foundation for the HK Health MCP Server project. It defines the core requirements and goals, acting as the source of truth for the project's scope.

## Project Name
HK Health MCP Server

## Purpose
To provide real-time data and tools related to health services in Hong Kong through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This includes waiting times for Accident and Emergency Departments, specialist outpatient services, and general outpatient clinic quotas.

## Core Requirements
1. **Data Accessibility**: Ensure up-to-date information on health service waiting times and quotas is accessible via API calls.
2. **Reliability**: Maintain high availability and accuracy of data fetched from official sources.
3. **User Interface**: While primarily an API service, consider future integration with user-friendly interfaces or dashboards.
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for developers to integrate with this MCP server.

## Goals
- Enable applications to integrate with health service data for better user experience.
- Support decision-making for patients and healthcare providers by providing timely data.
- Establish a scalable architecture for potential expansion to other health-related data services.

## Scope
This project focuses on data retrieval and presentation via MCP tools. It does not include direct patient management or clinical decision-making systems.

## Stakeholders
- Developers integrating with the MCP server.
- End-users seeking health service information.
- Healthcare administrators monitoring service loads.
