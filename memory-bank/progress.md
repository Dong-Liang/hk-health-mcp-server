# Progress

## What Works
- **Memory Bank Setup**: The foundational documentation structure has been established with the creation of core Memory Bank files including `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
- **Project Structure**: The basic repository structure for the HK Health MCP Server is in place, with directories for the main application, tools, and tests.
- **Initial Tools**: Preliminary MCP tools for fetching health service data (e.g., A&E waiting times, specialist waiting times, and general outpatient clinic quotas) are defined in the codebase.

## What's Left to Build
- **Data Retrieval Implementation**: Complete the development of MCP tools to fetch real-time data from official Hong Kong health service sources, ensuring robust error handling and data validation.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implement a caching layer (potentially using Redis) to store frequently accessed data, reducing load on external sources and improving response times.
- **Testing Suite**: Expand the test coverage for all MCP tools and server functionalities to ensure reliability across various scenarios, including data source failures.
- **Documentation Refinement**: Continuously update Memory Bank files with new insights, patterns, and technical decisions as the project evolves.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Define and document a deployment process for the MCP server, including environment setup, dependency installation, and server initialization.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement secure data transmission (HTTPS) and consider authentication mechanisms for API access to prevent unauthorized use.
- **Scalability Planning**: Design and test the server architecture for handling increased loads as more applications integrate with the service.

## Current Status
- **Development Phase**: Early stage, focusing on setting up documentation and planning the implementation of core functionalities.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive Memory Bank files are in place, providing a clear foundation for project context, architecture, and technical setup.
- **Codebase**: Initial structure and placeholder files for MCP tools are present, with active development starting on data retrieval functionalities.

## Known Issues
- **Data Source Reliability**: Potential issues with the availability and consistency of official health service data sources, which may require fallback mechanisms or alternative data retrieval strategies.
- **Rate Limiting**: Unconfirmed constraints on request frequency to data sources, which could impact real-time data updates without proper caching.
- **Scalability**: Current architecture is untested for high load scenarios, requiring future stress testing and potential redesign for distributed systems.
- **Security**: Initial setup lacks implemented security measures for data transmission and API access, which need to be addressed before public deployment.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Focus on Documentation**: Decision to prioritize comprehensive Memory Bank setup to ensure continuity across sessions due to memory resets, providing a solid base for future development.
- **Modular Design Choice**: Early adoption of a modular architecture for MCP tools to facilitate independent development and updates, reflecting a forward-thinking approach to scalability.
- **Technology Selection**: Choice of Python and FastAPI driven by the need for rapid development and asynchronous processing capabilities, aligning with the project's goal of real-time data delivery.
